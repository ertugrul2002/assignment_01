# Dimensionality Reduction with PCA and Streamlit Interface

## Overview

This project focuses on dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and building a user-friendly interface with Streamlit. You will analyze Knesset election data to discover clustering patterns among cities and political parties based on voting patterns.

## Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Implement PCA from scratch without using high-level libraries.
- Create visualizations to interpret clustering patterns.
- Build a Streamlit interface to interact with the data.

## Features

### Part 1: Data Processing and Analysis
1. **Load Dataset**  
   Load data from CSV/Excel into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Group and Aggregate Data**  
   Group by specified columns and aggregate using custom functions.

3. **Remove Sparse Columns**  
   Filter out columns with values below a specified threshold.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
   Implement PCA to reduce data dimensions while preserving metadata.

5. **Visualize Data**  
   Generate 2D and 3D scatter plots to explore clustering patterns using Plotly.

### Part 2: Streamlit User Interface (Bonus)
- Upload datasets.
- Configure grouping and aggregation settings.
- Set parameters for PCA and visualize results interactively.
